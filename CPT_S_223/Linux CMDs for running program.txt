Use ls and cd to get to working directory
Once you are in the directory with the cpp and h files make a directory called build: mkdir build
Now run command 
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
// Run the executable inside build
"-S" is path to source file,
"." Represents the current directory (CPTS-223-Examples/cmake-example),
-B: the path to build the project, in which we can find the executable files
Here we set the newly created directory “build” as this build path
cmake –build build
“--build”: the command for building this project according to the configuration in CMakeLists.txt
The second “build” is the newly created directory “build”
go into the build directory with cd build
run the executable withe ./ before it and it should run the file

cat (nameoffile) - print contents of file
more (filename) - print contents of entire file
