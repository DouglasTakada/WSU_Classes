# 322-Final-Project

### Designing a web-based application for Resident Advisors. The application will allow RAs to view floor and resident information. It allows RAs to learn their residents through a program that resembles flash-cards.

Milestones can be found under the "Milestones" folder

### Setup
1. Since in this project we are using PHP, you will need to install php for your hardware from here(I chose VS16 x64 Thread Safe for window and it worked): https://www.php.net/
2. Extract zipped php folder and save files into another folder
3. Add new php folder to path
4. Open command line interface and enter "php -v" to make sure you correctly installed php
5. Move to "prototypeSite" or "RA Site" directory and enter command php -S localhost:4000
6. open web browser and enter localhost:4000 to view website
7. Press ctrl + c in commandline to shut down server
